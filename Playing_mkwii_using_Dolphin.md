title: Playing mkwii using Dolphin
---

1. Download [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/download/)<br>**Note:** Only current development versions can play Wii ISOs in NKit format[^1]
2. Download the mkwii ROM if you don't already have one.
  * [From Vimm.net](https://vimm.net/vault/17746), or
  * [Archive.org](https://archive.org/download/WiiRedumpNKitPart4/Mario%20Kart%20Wii%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CEs%29/)

The rest is fairly straight forward, load the ISO up in Dolphin and get racing!
