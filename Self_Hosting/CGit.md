[CGit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/) - "A hyperfast web frontend for git repositories written in C."

I wanted to play around with this as an exercise. Currently it's on an internal server with no public facing access. I already have a code-hosting solution for myself. If I like CGit enough, it'll merely be to mirror repositories.
