> Author: Minimalist Baker

# Ingredients

|--:|:--|
|1 packet | instant (or rapid rise) yeast[^1] (2 1/4 tsp)|
|1 cup | unsweetened plain almond milk|
|3 tbsp + 3 tbsp + 2 tbsp<br>(1/2 cup) | Earth Balance (vegan butter), divided |
|1/4 tsp |salt|
|3 cups | unbleached all purpose flour[^2]|
|1 1/2 tsp | ground cinnamon|
|1/4 cup + 1 tbsp | organic cane sugar, divided|

# Instructions

1. In a large sauce pan (or in a bowl in the microwave at 30 sec increments), heat the almond milk and 3 Tbsp Earth Balance until warm and melted, never reaching boiling. Remove from heat and let cool to 110 degrees F (43 C), or the temperature of bath water. It should be warm but not too hot or it will kill the yeast.
0. Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl and sprinkle on yeast. Let activate for 10 minutes, then add 1 Tbsp sugar[^3] and the salt and stir.
0. Next add in flour 1/2 cup (68 g) at a time, stirring as you go. The dough will be sticky. When it is too thick to stir, transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for a minute or so until it forms a loose ball. Rinse your mixing bowl out, coat it with canola or grapeseed oil, and add your dough ball back in. Cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place to rise for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size (see photo).
0. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a thin rectangle. Brush with 3 Tbsp melted Earth Balance and top with 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 - 1 Tbsp cinnamon (to taste).
0. Starting at one end, tightly roll up the dough and situate seam side down. Then with a serrated knife or a string of floss, cut the dough into 1.5 - 2 inch sections and position in a well-buttered 8x8-inch square or comparable sized round pan (you should have about 10 rolls). Brush with remaining 2 Tbsp Earth Balance (melted) and cover with plastic wrap. Set on top of the oven to let rise again while you preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).
0. Once the oven is hot, bake rolls for 25-30 minutes or until slightly golden brown. Let cool for a few minutes and then serve immediately.

[^1]:You can use regular yeast, but it will require more time to let them rise properly.
[^2]:I have not tried making this recipe gluten free, however, many of you have had success with a blend of slept flour or whole wheat pastry. But for classic, fluffy cinnamon rolls, I recommend unbleached all purpose.
[^3]:In a double batch I ended up putting in 3 tbsp here.
