title: Cannabis Tea
---

1. [[Decarb cannabis|/Recipe/Cannabis/Decarboxylation]].<br>I usually use about 0.5g fresh ground flower + 1-2g shake/stems.
2. Let cool for a second. Start boiling some water.<br>I usually boil two mug-fulls of water. By the time I'm done boiling I'm usually left with about one mug-full of water.
3. Coat cannabis in a little bit of fat.<br>I've used Earth Balance, but coconut oil should work, too. I used about two teaspoons, just enough to form a very loose ball.
4. Add cannabis to tea ball or tea bag if you don't want to have to strain it later.
5. Add cannabis + some other flavor tea (optional) to boiling water.<br>I've used a ginger tea in the past which turned out very well.
6. Boil for about 15 minutes.
7. Let cool, and don't forget your space suit.

**Note:** That little bit of fat on the cannabis is not optional.
