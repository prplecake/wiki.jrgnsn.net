This recipe was transcribed from a scan from some unknown book.

# Ingredients

|--:|:--|
|6-1/2 cups | unbleached all purpose or bread flour |
|1-1/2 tbsp.|instant or bread machine yeast - two envelopes (7g or 1/4oz)|
|1-1/2 tbsp.|salt
|3 cups|lukewarm water - doesn't feel hot or cold on wrist

# Directions

1. Spoon the flour into a measuring cup, level with a knife or your finger, then dump into a mixing bowl.
0. Add the yeast and salt to the flour. Stir together with a wooden spoon or Danish dough whisk. Pour in the water and stir together until just moistened. Beat 40 strokes, scraping the bottom and the sides of the bowl, until the dough forms a lumpy, sticky mass.
0. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature in a draft free place for 2 hours or until the dough has risen nearly to the top of the bowl and has a sponge-like appearance.

**Use right away or refrigerate:** Use that day or place the dough, covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator for up to 9 days before baking.

**Preparing the oven and baking:** About 30 minutes before baking, place the broiler pan on the lower shelf and the baking stone on the middle shelf of the oven. Preheat 450 degrees. Place the bread on the cookie sheet that was prepared with cornmeal. Make three slices on top of the bread and rub with olive oil. Place bread in the oven then pour 2 cups of boiling water in the broiler pan and close the oven door immediately. Bake for 27-30 minutes until golden brown.
