# Notes from Izzy

* I did all the mixing in a stand mixer. A handheld one will do fine too but electric makes a huge difference in creaming.
* If the coconut oil isn't a soft solid at the start, it won't cream well and the texture will suffer.
* You can leave out the gluten but it won't have as good a texture.
* If you don't chill the dough, the coconut oil will melt too fast in the oven and the cookies will spread too much.
