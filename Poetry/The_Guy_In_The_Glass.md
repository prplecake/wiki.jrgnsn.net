title: The Guy In The Glass
---

<center><em>By Dale Wimbrow, (c) 1934</em>
<blockquote>When you get what you want in your struggle for pelf,<br />
And the world makes you King for a day,<br />
Then go to the mirror and look at yourself,<br />
And see what that guy has to say.<br /><br />

For it isn't your Father, or Mother, or Wife,<br />
Who judgement upon you must pass.<br />
The feller whose verdict counts most in your life<br />
Is the guy staring back from the glass.<br /><br />

He's the feller to please, never mind all the rest,<br />
For he's with you clear up to the end,<br />
And you've passed your most dangerous, difficult test<br />
If the guy in the glass is your friend.<br /><br />

You may be like Jack Horner and "chisel" a plum,<br />
And think you're a wonderful guy,<br />
But the man in the glass says you're only a bum<br />
If you can't look him straight in the eye.<br /><br />

You can fool the whole world down the pathway of years,<br />
And get pats on the back as you pass,<br />
But your final reward will be heartaches and tears<br />
If you've cheated the guy in the glass.<br />
</blockquote></center>
